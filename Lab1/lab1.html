        <h1>My name is Yujun Chen. I am a 4th year computer science major.</h1>
        <p>I took a class on webdesign in the senior year of highschool and now I'm taking a web design class in the senior year of college, deja vu. I'm taking this course both as a refresher and hoping to learn something new, also because I need a free elective credit.</p>
        <h1>My interest.</h1>
        <p>I have a very diverse interest in drawing, video games, and computer science. If binge watching TV shows and anime is considered an interest, I guess I'll add that to my list.</p>
